<p>Code for  was formed to bring people together to make Connecticut a better place. Our mission is <em>To focus on modernization and digital enablement for government and nonprofit organizations, increasing access to services aimed at underserved or disadvantaged communities.</em></p>

<p>To make that happen, we need <strong>projects</strong> and <strong>volunteers</strong>. You can see some of the <a href="../projects/">projects</a> we're planning to work on, but the most impactful projects will come from our community. We need you to join us in making things better. If you want to work on a project you see here, or you have a project idea, please reach out! We would love your help.</p>
