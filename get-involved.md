<p>Code for  was formed to bring people together to make Connecticut a better place. Our mission is <em>To organize and advocate for the use of public data and technology to make Louisville and Southern Indiana a more safe, resilient, and equitable place.</em></p>

<p>To make that happen, we need <strong>projects</strong> and <strong>volunteers</strong>. You can see some of the <a href="../projects/">projects</a> we're planning to work on, but the most impactful projects will come from our community. We need you to join us in making things better.
