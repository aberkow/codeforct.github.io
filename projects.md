<p>As a new brigade, one of the first things we're doing is thinking of projects that can positively impact the community.</p>

<p><em>We always want to hear about projects that you want to work on with us. We are an organization that will be driven by our community, and we're here to help connect people and build impactful projects. Please come to our meetings to work on existing projects or to bring your own!</em></p>

<p>We will follow Code for America's proven model for building services, which you can read about at <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/how">CodeForAmerica.org</a>.</p>

<p>
A criminal record can interfere with getting a job, housing, food assistance and other aspects of life. Many records are decades old and are eligible to be removed, but the process can be difficult. Even when a person is aware that they have a record that could be expunged, often financial and logistical barriers stand in the way.
</p>
<p>This project attempts to help pardon clinics in Connecticut clear records more quickly.</p>

<h3>Clean Up App</h3>
<h5>Potential Partner</h5>
<a href="https://www.ctriver.org/our-work/source-to-sea-cleanup">Connecticut River Conservancy </a><br>
<h5>Seed Project</h5>
<a href="http://www.codeforbtv.org/blog/official-green-day-mobile-app">Code For BTV's Green Up app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codeforbtv/green-up-app">Code For BTV's Green Up Administrator Dashboard</a>
<p>
The Source to Sea Cleanup is a yearly trash cleanup of the Connecticut River system all along the four-state watershed (NH, VT, MA, CT) – rivers & streams, shorelines, parks, boat launches, trails and more. Each fall, volunteer group leaders coordinate local cleanup sites where thousands of participants of all ages and abilities spend a few hours picking up trash. We all have a responsibility to solve this trash problem – individuals, manufacturers, businesses, and government. By participating in the Source to Sea Cleanup, you are part of the solution for cleaner rivers.
</p>
<p>The app will focus primarily on bringing people together, such as groups of friends or business employees who can coordinate their group clean ups. It will also enable users to pin where they are dropping their full trash bags, and to see where bags have already been dropped, potentially creating less overlap on areas that have already been cleaned.</p>
