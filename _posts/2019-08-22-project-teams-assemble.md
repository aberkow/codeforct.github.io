The Code For Connecticut Kick-Off Meeting was a great success, thanks to all our volunteers who came out to pitch projects and learn more about how we'll work together as a Code For America brigade! At tonight's meeting we formed project teams and announced a new team member and some upcoming events.

### New Team Member
Code For Connecticut announced Austin Ross as our new Community Organizer. Austin brings a wealth of knowledge from his engineering background and great enthuiasm to the brigade!

### [Projects](https://codeforconnecticut.org/projects)  
  
#### Amplify.org
This app helps Amplify.org amplify their web presence and decrease manual hours spent.  

#### Project Mill Rate
The purpose of Project Mill Rate is to extract public municipality mill rate data to extrapolate trends in property taxes of CT. This can perhaps shed light upon cost patterns of the past and future, which can influence our overall lifestyle and financial decisions.  
  
#### SurPlusPlus
SurPlusPlus is an app that shows exactly when and where there are surpluses of food, clothes, and other important (necessary for living) physical resources to more easily connect the supply and demand of surplus.

#### The Update CT
The Update CT will track past, current, and proposed legislation in Connecticut to identify, and ultimately, to predict, the effects of legislation in the state.  

### Upcoming Events  
  
#### [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2019)  

Join us on September 21st for the 7th Annual National Day of Civic Hacking, which brings together civic leaders, public servants, designers, coders, and engaged citizens to partner with local government and community groups to tackle some of our toughest challenges.  
  
This year we invite you to join us for a day of collective action to help those impacted by the criminal justice system, particularly in the area of record clearance. Have other pressing issues in your community that you’d like to work on? You’re welcome to join us too!  

#### [Brigade Congress](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade-congress)  

Code For Connecticut is going to Brigade Congress! Brigade Congress is a unique event that features leadership training for Brigade organizers, knowledge sharing, and opportunities to celebrate progress among the entire network.
