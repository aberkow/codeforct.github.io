Code for Connecticut, a local brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org), welcomes back our volunteer community with a relaunch meeting on Wednesday, June 16th. Come join us!

Code for Connecticut is the first Code for America [Brigade](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org) for Connecticut. Currently, there are 80+ Brigades across the United States, bringing together community organizers, developers, and designers to use technology to improve the lives of citizens. Code For Connecticut’s mission is to focus on modernization and digital enablement for government and nonprofit organizations, increasing access to services aimed at underserved or disadvantaged communities.

The Code For America network is organized as a safe space for all people, and everyone must adhere to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). Please take a moment to review and understand expectations, and, as always, if there’s ever an issue you can email [safespace@codeforamerica.org](mailto:safespace@codeforamerica.org)
