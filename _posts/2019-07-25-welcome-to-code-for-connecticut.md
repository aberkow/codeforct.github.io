Code for Connecticut, a local brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org), celebrates its kick-off meeting today. Core team members Jonathan Payne, José Padilla, and Ellen Last are excited to welcome all of our new members!

Code for Connecticut is the first Code for America [Brigade](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org) for Connecticut. Currently, there are 80+ Brigades across the United States, bringing together community organizers, developers, and designers to use technology to improve the lives of citizens. Code For Connecticut’s mission is to focus on modernization and digital enablement for government and nonprofit organizations, increasing access to services aimed at underserved or disadvantaged communities.

The Code For America network is organized as a safe space for all people, and everyone must adhere to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct). Please take a moment to review and understand expectations, and, as always, if there’s ever an issue you can email [safespace@codeforamerica.org](mailto:safespace@codeforamerica.org)

Finally, Code For Connecticut extends a heartfelt Thank You to Tech Talent Connecticut for promoting this event, to Upward Hartford for hosting, and to all of our participants for joining us to help make Connecticut a better place for everyone!
