	<p>"As a Connecticut native and longtime member of the IT community, I'm excited to be founder and captain of Code For Connecticut. A recent graduate of Burlington Code Academy, I experienced firsthand the vibrancy of the growing tech hub in Burlington, Vermont, where I began volunteering with Code For BTV. I'm inspired by their enhtusiasm and commitment to make the world a better place, which is the hallmark of the Code For America brigade. I will work every day to bring that same spirit to Code For Connecticut."</p>
